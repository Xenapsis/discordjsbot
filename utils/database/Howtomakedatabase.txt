Hello, to make a database for this all you need to do is 
go into the directory of this file (utils/database) and type "sqlite3 database.db" in the command line (Must have sqlite3 installed)
Next you will need to make the table type "CREATE TABLE data(userid INT NOT NULL, Time INT, Premium INT);"
And now your database is ready!
